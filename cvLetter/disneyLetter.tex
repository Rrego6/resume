\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

I spoke to recruiters for Citi at the College of Computing Georgia Tech career fair and I was interested in an internship position for the summer at Citi. I'm a 3rd year CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in Information Internetworks and System Architecture. I have 3 co-op semesters worth of experience in professional mobile application development and a solid grasp of software development fundamentals. 

I'm partial to fullstack web development because I plan on doing that in the future. However, I would be interested in other, perhaps unrelated development positions because my primary goal with this internship is to expose myself to new things. Working at a bank would provide a unique opportunity for exploration, especially in regards to clearing transactions.

I would be a great fit for this internship position because I truly love learning about software development and because I already have experience in professional software development.  As described to me by the recruiter, the internship gives me broad exposure to what Citi does and to working at a large company; I think that experience would be invaluable.


\closing{Regards,}
\end{letter}
