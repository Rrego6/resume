\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

	I spoke to recruiters for Bloomberg at the College of Computing Georgia Tech career fair and I was interested in the 2018 Software Engineer - Graduate Programme. I'm a senior CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in Information Internetworks and System Architecture. Throughout my work experience, I have worked along the spectrum of application development. My last internship was at the AT\&T Entertainment Group, where I worked on our new microservices platform, helping to build out our Content Delivery Network manager which we use for Video on Demand utilizing Java with Spring to create our APIs, along with Polymer and NodeJS to build out the dashboard for this tool. Prior to that, I was working at Dell in the Dell Financial Services department writing the business logic for credit checking utilizing .NET and PL/SQL. I began my professional software deveopment experience at Nead Werx with three co-op semesters of mobile application development, developing our ERP solution by writing features for our mobile applications and API.

	Because I have considerable experience in software development for a new graduate, I believe I would be a great fit for this Software Engineering position. As a future new graduate, a training program to learn about the environment I will be working in, as opposed to the typical crash course to get started in a project in an internship, would be extremely useful.

	I would be a great fit for this internship position because I truly love learning about software development, and because I already have considerable experience in professional software development.  As described to me by the recruiter, this internship gives me broad exposure to what Bloomberg does; I think that experience would be invaluable.


\closing{Regards,}
