\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

I spoke to recruiters for Citibank at the College of Computing Georgia Tech career fair and I was interested in an internship position for the summer at Citibank. I'm a 3rd year CS major at the Georgia Institute of Techonology specializing in Information Internetworks and System Architecture. I have 3 co-op semesters worth of experience in professional mobile application development. Indeed, 


I'm partial to fullstack web development, because I plan on doing that in the future. However, I would be interested in other, perhaps unrelated development positions because my primary goal with this internship is to expose myself to new things. Working at a large bank provides a unique opportunity to handle issues related to clearing transactions.

I would be a great fit for an internship position because I truly love learning about software development and because I already have experience in professional software development.




\closing{Regards,}
\end{letter}
