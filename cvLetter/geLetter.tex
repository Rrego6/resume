\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

I spoke to recruiters for GE at the College of Computing Georgia Tech career fair and I was interested in an internship position for the summer at GE Digital. I'm a 3rd year CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in Information Internetworks and System Architecture. I have 3 co-op semesters worth of experience in professional mobile application development and a competent grasp of software development fundamentals. 

I'm partial to fullstack web development, because I plan on doing that in the future. However, I would be interested in other, perhaps unrelated development positions because my primary goal with this internship is to expose myself to new things. Working at a large manufacuring company would provide a unique opportunity for exploration.

I would be a great fit for this internship position because I truly love learning about software development and because I already have experience in professional software development. As described to me by the recruiter, the internship gives me broad exposure to what GE does and to working at a large company; I think that experience would be invaluable.




\closing{Regards,}
\end{letter}
